# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Allow the satellite map column to expand to 90% screen width when clicked.

**Planned changes:**
- Modify click handler on the map column to expand it to 90% screen width
- Collapse the other two columns to share the remaining 10% width when map is expanded
- Ensure clicking the map again or another column restores the default layout
- Apply smooth transitions consistent with existing column expansion behavior

**User-visible outcome:** Users can click on the satellite map column to expand it to cover 90% of the screen, providing a larger view of the map while keeping the other columns minimally visible.
