  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all core PWA requirements. manifest.json, service worker, index.html meta tags, and service worker registration are implemented. However, REQ-5 (icon generation) is not fulfilled - the implementation references icon paths but does not include the actual icon files in the diff.",

      "requirement": "Generate app icons as required images to support PWA installation with proper sizes and formats for both Android and iOS devices",
      "reason": "The manifest.json and index.html reference icon paths (/assets/generated/icon-192.dim_192x192.png, icon-512.dim_512x512.png, apple-touch-icon.dim_180x180.png), but no actual icon image files were added in the diff. Only configuration files reference these icons.",
