  "summary": "The diff shows implementation of zoom stability improvements in MapView.tsx through debounced tile loading, enhanced ResizeObserver management with longer settle delays, concurrent render prevention, and stable rendering during zoom transitions. The implementation addresses REQ-1's flickering fix through multiple mechanisms but lacks explicit evidence of REQ-2's testing scenarios.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Test the zoom functionality across different scenarios including rapid zoom operations, touch gestures on mobile, and zoom with active GPS trails being rendered",
      "reason": "No test files, test code, or testing documentation present in the diff. Only implementation changes to MapView.tsx are shown.",
